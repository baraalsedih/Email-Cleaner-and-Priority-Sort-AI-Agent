# Email Cleaner & Priority Sort AI Agent

An intelligent n8n workflow that automatically classifies, organizes, and prioritizes your Gmail emails using AI. This workflow runs daily to help you maintain a clean and organized inbox by categorizing emails into Important, Can Wait, or Spam categories.

## üöÄ Features

- **AI-Powered Classification**: Uses Google Gemini to intelligently categorize emails
- **Automatic Gmail Labeling**: Applies appropriate labels based on priority
- **Discord Notifications**: Get notified about important emails instantly
- **Scheduled Processing**: Runs automatically every day at 8 AM
- **Smart Summarization**: Provides concise summaries of email content

## üìã How It Works

1. **Schedule Trigger**: Runs daily at 8 AM
2. **Fetch Emails**: Retrieves recent Gmail messages
3. **AI Analysis**: Google Gemini analyzes each email and classifies it as:
   - **Important**: Actionable or high-priority (work, clients, deadlines, bills)
   - **Can Wait**: Low-priority (newsletters, notifications, social media)
   - **Spam**: Unwanted, promotional, or irrelevant content
4. **Auto-Labeling**: Applies Gmail labels based on classification
5. **Notifications**: Sends Discord notification for important emails

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before importing this workflow, you'll need:

- n8n instance (cloud or self-hosted)
- Gmail account with API access
- Google Gemini API key
- Discord webhook (optional, for notifications)

## üì• Installation

### 1. Import the Workflow

1. Download the `Email Cleaner & Priority Sort AI Agent.json` file
2. In your n8n instance, go to **Workflows**
3. Click **Import from file** or **Import from clipboard**
4. Select the downloaded JSON file

### 2. Set Up Required Credentials

#### Gmail OAuth2 Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable Gmail API
4. Create OAuth2 credentials
5. In n8n, create a new **Gmail OAuth2** credential
6. Follow the OAuth flow to authorize access

#### Google Gemini API Setup
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create a new API key
3. In n8n, create a new **Google Gemini (PaLM) API** credential
4. Enter your API key

#### Discord Webhook Setup (Optional)
1. In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings** ‚Üí **Integrations**
2. Click **Create Webhook**
3. Copy the webhook URL
4. In n8n, create a new **Discord Webhook** credential
5. Paste the webhook URL

### 3. Configure Gmail Labels

Create these labels in your Gmail account:
- **Important** (or any custom name for high-priority emails)
- **Can Wait** (or any custom name for low-priority emails)
- The workflow will automatically use the **Spam** label

After creating labels, you'll need to update the label IDs in the workflow:
1. Go to Gmail
2. Get label IDs from the URL when viewing each label
3. Update the `labelIds` in the respective Gmail nodes

### 4. Customize Settings

#### Schedule Configuration
- Default: Daily at 8 AM
- To change: Edit the **Schedule Trigger** node
- Options: Hourly, daily, weekly, or custom cron expression

#### AI Prompt Customization
- Edit the **Basic LLM Chain** node to modify classification criteria
- Adjust categories or add new classification rules
- Customize the summary format

## üîß Configuration Options

- **AI processing** uses Google Gemini API (check their privacy policy)
- **OAuth tokens** are securely managed by n8n

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to parse cleaned Gemini response"**
   - The AI response format might be inconsistent
   - Check the Code node for JSON parsing errors
   - Consider adding more robust error handling

2. **Gmail API Rate Limits**
   - Reduce the frequency of the schedule trigger
   - Add delays between API calls
   - Implement exponential backoff

3. **Label IDs Not Working**
   - Ensure Gmail labels exist
   - Update label IDs in the workflow
   - Check Gmail API permissions

4. **Discord Notifications Not Sending**
   - Verify webhook URL is correct
   - Check Discord channel permissions
   - Test webhook independently

### Debug Mode
1. Enable debug mode in n8n
2. Run the workflow manually
3. Check execution logs for detailed error messages
4. Test individual nodes to isolate issues
